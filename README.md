INSTRUCTIONS:

 > run arbitrage_bot.py to fetch market data from exchanges, detect arbitrage oppurtunities, and exploit them for profit. (see log.txt and profitable_exchanges.txt to see results)

 > run assess.py to assess the performance of each exchange individually and the overall performance of the bot. (will generate detailed assessment.txt file)


This project was designed and programmed entirely by me (Antoine Dangeard) as a side project throughout winter vacation (20th December '21 to 4th January '22).
