we need to confirm which exchanges are worth the loading time (cents per hour / loading time)

instead of doing all at once could do one by one (each exchange gets an hour, something like that)
however this doesn't factor how many times an exchange gets a NEW conversion, that is still difficult to determine without actually exploiting the oppurtunities


need to have like 10-20 dollars on each and make consistent cents
