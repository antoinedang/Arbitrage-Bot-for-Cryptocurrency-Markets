Have BTC and USD to buy/sell on several exchanges
if the price difference between two exchanges is big enough to make up ofr transaction costs then buy BTC on cheap exchange and sell same amount of BTC on expensive one. Then you have the same amount of BTC but more USD.


OR on only one exchange, transfer money between currencies to make profit
	e.g. convert money from USD -> some combinations of currencies -> USD to make profit on inconsistencies in market



exchanges:
binance (2nd strat)
gemini
